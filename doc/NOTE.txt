These are notes I put together developing firmware for banana pro.


*** this project references a bunch of other projects. For convenient, git submodule is used.

   a) setup a submodule, you have to commit your project after.
      git submodule add git-url

   b) when checkout a fresh copy, you need to initialize the submodule. git only stores the 
      git hash for the last check in. you most likely want to branch if you need to do something with the
      submodule.

      git submodule init
      git submodule update

   c) a convenient command for submodule is to apply git command to all the modules

      git submodule foreach git co master


*** github and git mirror is used. to set up git mirror, do


    a) clone with mirror to get all the meta data. this include all the branches and tags.

       git clone --mirror git-url local-git

    b) add remote to local

       git remote add github github.com:repository

    c) push the mirror to github

       git push github --mirror








Directory Hierarhcy
===================
Here are the important directories:

     /banana/tools/sunxi       - a place to store all the tools. sunxi is the processor for banana pro.
     /banana/sysroot	       - root file system

     working/package	       - package description
     working/module	       - locally developed modules.
     working/Gen	       - all generated files
     working/Gen/build	       - build directory



Building
========
Firmware for the banana pro is a collection of open source project. We can generalize the building
of these packages into the following steps:

    a) download
       download the project. the common way to download project is via url or from some version
       controlled repository.

    b) source
       once downloaded, the source target unpacks into the build directory

    c) patch
       apply patches to source

    d) configure
       configure the source to be built

    e) compile
       compile the source

    f) install
       install the compiled program to the target root file system
